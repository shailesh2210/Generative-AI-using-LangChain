## 🚀 Generative AI Learning Journey (Starting Point)

This repository is the beginning of my Generative AI learning journey where I will be learning, practicing, and building real-world applications using Large Language Models (LLMs), LangChain, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), and AI Agents.

Right now, I'm just getting started — setting up the structure and beginning with fundamentals.
As I move ahead, I’ll keep updating this README and the entire repo with:

Notes

Practical exercises

Code implementations

End-to-end projects

This repo will become my Generative AI portfolio.

### 📁 Repository Structure (Initial Setup)

```
genai-learning/
│
├── 1-Fundamentals/
├── 2-RAG/
├── 3-Agents/
├── projects/
└── README.md
```

As I learn more, each folder will be filled with:

- Markdown notes

- Practical notebooks

- Real projects

- Demos

- Diagrams

## 🎯 What I’m Starting With

Since this is Day 1, I’m beginning with the Fundamentals of Generative AI, mainly:

- What is LangChain

- LangChain components

- Models

- Prompts

- Output parsing

- Runnables (LCEL)

- Chains

- Memory

- Indexes

Once I complete fundamentals, I’ll expand this README with details, examples, and progress badges.

## 🚧 What’s Coming Next

As I continue learning, I’ll add sections such as:

✔ Practical Hands-On Work

Exercises + notebooks + small demos.

✔ Full RAG Systems

Document loading → chunking → embeddings → vector stores → retrieval → LLM.

✔ AI Agents

Tool calling → multi-step reasoning → actionable assistants.

✔ Mini Projects

A collection of real GenAI apps built for my portfolio.

✔ Deployment

Streamlit, FastAPI, HuggingFace Spaces, etc.

Every time I finish a section, this README will grow with more details.

## 📌 Current Status: Starting the Fundamentals

I'm just setting up the repo and beginning my first topic.
Progress updates will be added here step-by-step.

## 🧠 Why I'm Doing This

To build:

- Confidence

- Strong foundations

- A real GenAI portfolio

Skills needed for AI/ML/Data Science roles

This repo will act as proof of learning and a reference for future projects.

## 🤝 Updates Coming Soon…

This README is just the beginning.
More sections, diagrams, code, and projects will be added as I move forward.

Stay tuned. 🚀🔥
